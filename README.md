# Predictive-Maintenance
Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help anticipate equipment failures to allow for advance scheduling of corrective maintenance, thereby preventing unexpected equipment downtime, improving service quality for customers, and also reducing the additional cost caused by over-maintenance in preventative maintenance policies.
In this project, to predict the machine failure and type of failure, Machine learning models are build on jupyter notebook and their accuracy scores are compared. 
Finally, the model with highest accuracy is accepted.
